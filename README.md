#### Resume website
Project inspired by [Prof Rossetti](https://prof-rossetti.org/) as part of the Georgetown MBA class Internet Business Technologies.

Project created with inspiration from the following Bootstrap template [https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume/](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume/)


#### Website Creation

##### 1) Planning
I have a background in sales, strategy and finance in tech and since I am going in tech banking, I wanted to learn more intricacies of the world of technology. I wanted to highlight some of my work and achivements and wanted to reflect my interests too. 

I worked on five sections:
  1)About
  2)Experience
  3)Education
  4)Interests
  5)Awards

##### 2) Designing

...

I started planning five pages or sections to feature on my page and used the[Bootstrap theme](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume/) to create the website. I thought having the navbar on the side was judicious for putting emphasis on the content.


##### 3) Implementation
I initially had issues figuring out the colors of the site but was able to figure it out later via bg primary element in a css style file. 


##### Special thanks
Paul Kassar for his help throughout the process, discussing content and selecting sections to highlight.
